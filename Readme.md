# Basic neural nets

This project implements a variety of simple neural models for the following problem domains
* MNIST
	* Needs the data from [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
* Facial Representation 
	* Needs the data from [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) to be placed in Data/fer2013
	
It also implements some basic functions for neural nets
* Dropout
* Momentum
* Full, batch, stochastic gradient descent
* RMSProp
